1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Operator |	Symbol |	Description |	Example
Addition	+ |	Adds two numbers or expressions.	 | [Price] + [Tax]
Subtraction	- |Subtracts one number from another. |	[Revenue] - [Cost]
Multiplication	* |	Multiplies two numbers or expressions. |	[Price] * [Quantity]
Division	/ |	Divides one number by another. |	[Total] / [Count]
Exponentiation	^ |	Raises a number to a power. |	[Base] ^ [Power]


Example:
[Total Sales] = [Price] * [Quantity]
This calculates the total sales by multiplying the price by the quantity sold.

2. Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare values. The result of these operations is either TRUE or FALSE, making them essential for logical expressions and conditional calculations.

Operator|	Symbol |	Description	 | Example
Equal To	= |	Checks if two values are equal. |	[Sales] = 1000
Not Equal To	<> | Checks if two values are not equal. |	[Revenue] <> 5000
Greater Than	> |	Checks if one value is greater than another. |	[Profit] > 10000
Less Than	< |	Checks if one value is less than another. |	[Discount] < 0.1
Greater Than or Equal To |	>= |	Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another. |	[Revenue] >= 5000
Less Than or Equal To |	<= |	Checks if one value is less than or equal to another. |	[Cost] <= 100
Example:
[Is High Value] = IF([Sales] > 5000, "Yes", "No")
This expression checks whether the sales are greater than 5000 and returns "Yes" if true and "No" if false.

3. Text (Concatenation) Operator &
The concatenation operator is used to join two or more text strings together.

Operator |	Symbol	 | Description |	Example
Concatenation	&	Joins two or more text strings together.	[First Name] & " " & [Last Name]
Example:
[Full Name] = [First Name] & " " & [Last Name]
This joins the first and last names together, with a space between them, to create a full name.

4. Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions or to return boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) based on the evaluation of expressions.

Operator	Symbol	Description	Example:
AND	&&	Returns TRUE if both conditions are true.	[Sales] > 500 && [Profit] > 100
OR	`		`
[High Sales and High Profit] = IF([Sales] > 5000 && [Profit] > 1000, "Yes", "No")
This checks if both sales and profit exceed a certain threshold, returning "Yes" if both conditions are true.

5. Conditional (IF) Operator
The IF function is used to evaluate a condition and return one value if TRUE, and another value if FALSE.
Example:
IF	IF	Performs a logical test and returns values based on conditions.	IF([Sales] > 1000, "High", "Low")
Example:

arduino
Copy code
IF([Profit] > 0, "Profit", "Loss")
This checks if profit is greater than zero, and returns "Profit" if true, and "Loss" if false.

6. IN Operator
The IN operator is used to check if a value exists within a specified list of values.
IN	Checks if a value is in a list.	IF([Country] IN {"US", "UK"}, "Yes", "No")
Example:
IF([Region] IN {"North", "East", "South"}, "Valid", "Invalid")
This checks if the region value is one of the specified regions, returning "Valid" if true.

7. Switch Operator
The SWITCH function evaluates an expression against a list of values and returns the corresponding result.
SWITCH	SWITCH	Returns different results based on conditions.	SWITCH([Category], "A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3, 0)
Example:
SWITCH([Grade], "A", "Excellent", "B", "Good", "C", "Average", "F", "Fail", "Unknown")
This switches between values in the Grade column and returns a text result based on the grade.
